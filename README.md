### Hi, I'm Jaymini! ðŸ‘‹

I have an analytical background in economics, accounts and finance. I have developed a strong foundation in data manipulation and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights through reports. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed developed my statistical analysis skills. I also gained professional experience in the insurance underwriting industry, managing records, and creating insight-driven reports for senior management, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
