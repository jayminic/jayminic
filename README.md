### Hey there! ![hi](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9fcde363f6e46385fd7bc47ef8edd937acaa2c872216105ab0475369f1c1a005/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966)
I’m Jaymini, a postgraduate data science and AI student based in the UK.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are figma, apple notes, and procreate on my iPad.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the Anime Scene Gallery.

I’ve built over 100 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 200 at this point.

If you want to learn how i do it, my books and course are available here!

**Fun Facts:**
- I have two cats
- I don’t like coffee or tea
- Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
- **Hobbies:** anime, gym, building things
