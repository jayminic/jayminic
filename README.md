# Hi there, I’m Jaymini 👋

I'm a tech enthusiast with a background in accounts, data, and creative problem-solving. My journey has led me to the world of **full-stack development**, where I’m excited to blend creativity and technical skills to build dynamic, user-centred applications.

### About Me

- 💻 **Aspiring Developer**: Currently focused on enhancing my coding skills and exploring new frameworks as I work toward a career in app development.
- 🔍 **Data & Detail-Oriented**: I have experience in data analysis and reporting, combined with a knack for process improvement and efficiency.
- 🧠 **Lifelong Learner**: Whether it’s learning new languages or experimenting with personal projects, I’m always eager to grow and take on new challenges.

### Interests

I’m particularly drawn to project-based work in **tech start-ups** and industries like **fin-tech**, **gaming**, and **productivity/studying**. I enjoy creating solutions that are both functional and visually engaging.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!
